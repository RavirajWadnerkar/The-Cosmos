			<h1><a href="#the-cosmos-1">The <em>Cosmos</em> is all there is</a></h1>
			<h2>Or ever was, or ever will be</h2>

			<time datetime="03-09-2014">MAR. 9, 2014</time>
			<p>
				<em>A generation ago</em>, the astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_sagan">Carl Sagan</a> stood here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure the exploration of the universe revealed by science.
				It's time to get going again.
				We're about to begin a journey that will take us from the infinitesimal to the infinite, from the dawn of time to the distant future.
				We'll explore galaxies and suns and worlds, surf the gravity waves of space-time, encounter beings that live in fire and ice, explore the planets of stars that never die, discover atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms.

			<h3>COSMOS IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT US</h3>
			<p>
				It's the saga of how wandering bands of hunters and gatherers found their way to the stars, one adventure with many heroes.
				To make this journey, we'll need imagination.
				But imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine.
				This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules test ideas by experiment and observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail, follow the evidence wherever it leads and question everything.
				<strong>Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.</strong>

			<h3>The Vastness of the Universe:</h3>
			<p>The universe is unimaginably vast, comprising billions of galaxies, each containing billions of stars. The scale of the cosmos is mind-boggling, with distances measured in light-years, the distance light travels in a year. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is just one of billions in the universe, and it alone spans tens of thousands of light-years.</p>

			<h3>The Beauty of the Cosmos:</h3>
			<p>Despite its vastness, the universe is also remarkably beautiful. From the graceful dance of galaxies in deep space to the delicate hues of nebulae, the cosmos is a visual feast. Photographs from space telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope have captured stunning images of distant galaxies, colorful nebulae, and the birth and death of stars.</p>

			<h3>The Complexity of the Cosmos:</h3>
			<p>The universe is not just vast and beautiful; it is also incredibly complex. From the fundamental forces that govern the behavior of matter to the intricate structures of galaxies, stars, and planets, the cosmos is a tapestry of complexity. Scientists are still unraveling the mysteries of the universe, seeking to understand its origins, evolution, and ultimate fate.</p>

			<h3>Our Place in the Cosmos:</h3>
			<p>As we explore the cosmos, we are also exploring our place within it. Earth, our home planet, is but a tiny speck in the vastness of space, yet it is uniquely suited for life as we know it. The study of other planets, moons, and exoplanets has broadened our understanding of what it means to be a planet and how life might exist elsewhere in the universe.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
			<p>The cosmos is a vast, beautiful, and complex place, filled with wonders beyond our wildest imagination. As we continue to explore and study the universe, we gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty, complexity, and fragility of our own planet and our place within the cosmos.</p>
